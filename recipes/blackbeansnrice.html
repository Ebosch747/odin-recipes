        <h3>Easy and Cheap!</h3>
        <p>If you’ve been here for a while you know I’m all about easy recipes. I think this Instant Pot Black Beans and Rice recipe is my new favorite. Why? Because you can cook black beans and brown rice together in the Instant Pot! No soaking or precooking. It turns out great, like magic. </p>
        <p>That is one of the main reasons I love my Instant Pot. It makes life easier for me. You may love your slow cooker, I used to use mine a lot more. Which ever you choose, having tools that make life more efficient and that set you up to be successful in your goals is a good investment.</p>
